{"name":"MAPI project","tagline":"The main #mappiamo repository","body":"## #mappiamo geoCMS\r\n======\r\n\r\n### What is #mappiamo?\r\n #mappiamo is a CMS that allows you to create and leverage content through the use of OpenData, the geo-location and microformats. It can be used for processing the data produced by public administrations, collect content (crowdsourcing), civic hacking and provide a basis for the portal of a smart city.\r\n #mappiamo, is a suitable tool to build websites and combine the contents ensuring ownership and originality for each of the data providers. It is suitable to marketing 3.0 where it is important to the credibility of the sharing of experiential baggage of both operators and consumers.\r\n\r\nThe cms today allows the insertion of text and multimedia contents. The license management, geotagging and the application of schemes for the representation of linked data is the prerogative of external plugins. All plugins are to install and study separately.\r\n #mappiamo is also able to take advantage of the shared data, peer-to-peer networks from other sites and thus produce content in compliance with the Linked Data 5 star suggested by Tim Berners-Lee.\r\n\r\n### Features for potential customers\r\nIn addition to the individual websites of public houses, small communities or associations up to the bigger organizations are able to benefit from the use of open data and web data (linked data). While the sites of tour operators, real estate portals and smart cities would have every incentive to take advantage of the verified data produced by smaller sites.\r\nJust think about the usefulness of free parking spaces, timetables of public transport, bike sharing and other services offered by the community.\r\n\r\nWant to collaborate or you just want to test #mappiamo?
